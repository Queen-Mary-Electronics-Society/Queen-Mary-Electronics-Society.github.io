Line following robots are an excellent introduction to robotics and automation. In this project, students learn about sensors, microcontrollers, and basic programming while building their own autonomous robot that can follow a black line on a white surface.

## Project Overview
Students will design and build their own line follower robot from scratch. The project covers PCB design, component selection, soldering, programming, and testing. We use infrared sensors to detect the line and a microcontroller to process the sensor data and control the motors.

## Technical Details
The robot uses QTR-8A reflectance sensors, an Arduino Nano for processing, and dual DC motors with an L298N motor driver. Students learn about PID control to make the robot follow the line smoothly and efficiently.
