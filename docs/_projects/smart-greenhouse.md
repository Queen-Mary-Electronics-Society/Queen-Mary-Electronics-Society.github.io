The Smart Greenhouse project combines IoT technology with environmental monitoring to create an automated plant care system. Students build a small-scale greenhouse that monitors and controls temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and lighting conditions.

## Sensor Integration
The system uses multiple sensors including DHT22 for temperature and humidity, capacitive soil moisture sensors, and light intensity meters. An ESP32 microcontroller collects data from these sensors and uploads it to a cloud dashboard. Students learn about sensor calibration, data acquisition, and wireless communication protocols.

## Automation and Control
Based on sensor data, the system automatically controls ventilation fans, water pumps, and LED grow lights. A web interface allows remote monitoring and control of the greenhouse environment. Students implement control algorithms and create a user-friendly dashboard using Node.js and React.
