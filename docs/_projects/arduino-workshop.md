Our Arduino Workshop Series is designed to take students from complete beginners to confident makers. Through hands-on projects and interactive sessions, participants learn fundamental electronics and programming concepts while building exciting projects.

## Workshop Structure
The workshop is divided into six weekly sessions, each building upon the previous one. We start with basic circuits and Arduino programming fundamentals, then progress to sensors, actuators, and finally complete IoT projects. Each participant receives their own Arduino kit to keep.

## Projects Overview
Throughout the workshop, students complete various projects including LED light shows, temperature monitoring systems, servo-controlled robots, and WiFi-enabled home automation devices. Each project introduces new components and programming concepts.
